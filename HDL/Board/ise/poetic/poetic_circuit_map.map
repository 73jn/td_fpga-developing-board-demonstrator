WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net resetSynch is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <I0/I0/I_txFifo/g1.I0/Mram_memoryArray1_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
